Omni Bootstrap
==============
Client libraries and theme for Omni web apps

Theme
-----
The bootstrap library currently exposes a single Omni theme, which you can import into your existing SASS application:

```scss
@import "omni-bootstrap/assets/stylesheets/omni"
```

The theme is meant to override the default styles in the [bootstrap-sass][1] project.
